# Worksheet template placement

Put your HWP template file here with this exact name:

- `worksheet_template.hwp`

Note:

- Some downloads/editors may accidentally save the file as `worksheet_template.hwp.hwp`.
- The app now accepts **both** names, but the recommended/standard name remains `worksheet_template.hwp`.

This folder is intended to be bundled with the app on distribution (e.g. ship `templates/` next to the EXE), so you can swap templates without rebuilding.

## Recommended distribution layout

If you distribute as an EXE, keep:

- `<app-folder>\CH_LMS.exe`
- `<app-folder>\templates\worksheet_template.hwp`

## Alternative (machine-wide) location

If you prefer a shared location across users on the same PC, you can also keep the template at:

- `C:\Users\Public\CH_LMS\templates\worksheet_template.hwp`

You can choose one approach and standardize on it.
